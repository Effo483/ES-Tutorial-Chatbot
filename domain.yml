  utter_greet:
  - text: Hi there, I am your virtual assistant. I can help you to build UML based programs using the SiSy tool. You can request a tutorial by typing the tutorial name.
  utter_tutorial_manual:
  - text: 'This is how it works: In the beginning of each tutorial I will ask you some questions about your controller type etc. After that, the first step of the tutorial will beginn. If you have trouble to complete the tutorial step you can ask me any of the listed questions. Otherwise you can write "next", "continue" or simply"nx" to get to the next step. If you have accidentally given wrong information or want to start over, you can reset the dialog by typing "restart".'
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  utter_submit:
  - text: I have all the info I need, thanks!
  utter_scope:
  - text: You can ask me how to add a sensor or some questions about SiSy or embedded software.
  utter_ask_controller_type:
  - text: What kind of Microcontroller do you have? Atmega AVR, STM32 or XMC?
  utter_out_of_scope:
  - text: Sorry, I can't handel that request.
  utter_ask_rephrase:
  - text: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
  utter_default:
  - text: I'm sorry, I can't help you.
  utter_ask_setup:
  - text: Do you also need help with the initial setup?
  utter_faq/which_microcontrollers_do_you_support:
  - text: Currently I support AVR, STM32 and XMC. 
  utter_faq/how_to_connect_classes:
  - text: Left click and hold on the bottom box of one class. Now drag the cursor to another class to make a connection.
  utter_faq/compile_error:
  - text: One possibility is to download PEC with examples when starting a new project. There you can look at pre build examples that work and look for differences.
  utter_faq/no_st_link:
  - text: Usually this problem occurs because of using a virtual machine and using windows on top of it, which leads to some confusions with the installed driver detection. Or even sometimes, it helps to connect the board and then restart the PC, instead of plugging the board while/after PC and/or software tool.
  utter_faq/what_is_realisation:
  - text: Realization is a specialized abstraction relationship between two sets of model elements, one representing a specification (the supplier) and the other represents an implementation of the latter (the client).
  utter_faq/what_is_aggregation:
  - text: An aggregation relationship can be described in simple words as an object of one class can own or access the objects of another class.
  utter_faq/what_is_pull_up:
  - text: Open inputs are sensitive receivers for all kinds of electromagnetic waves. The input delivers virtually arbitrary signals. So-called pull-down or pull-up resistors provide a remedy here. These pull the line to a defined potential and thus suppress it. In the past, these pull-up resistors were explicitly built into the circuit (activated with a soldering iron, so to speak). Modern controllers have internal PullUp and PullDown resistors. If necessary, these simply have to be activated by software.

Create a new class diagram by dragging a class diagram into the workspace. Select the language ARM C++. Choose your hardware and programmer. When opening the diagram (right mouse button, down) load from the SiSy LibStore the diagram template Application Grundgerüst for PEC applications (XMC, STM32, AVR). Search the explorer for the appropriate MCU package. In addition, you can use the library component stm32F042_48Mhz from the explorer to operate the controller with full 48MHz power. You can test if everything works by connecting your microcontroller'

  - text: It is also possible to make the LED blink. You can use the methods indicatorLED.toggle() and waitMs(<time in ms>) for that. Give it a try! Do you want to see the solution?
